    subtitle:
      "Egor Nevezhin, Nikolay Butakov, Maria Khodorchenko, Maxim Petrov, Denis Nasonov",
    text: "Online advertising is one of the most widespread ways to reach and increase a target audience for those selling products. Usually having a form of a banner, advertising engages users into visiting a corresponding webpage. Professional generation of banners requires creative and writing skills and a basi…",

    title: "Convolutional neural networks",
    subtitle: "Ksenia D Mukhina, Alexander A Visheratin",
    text: "In this work, we consider a problem of predicting the next state of a given area using retrospective information. The proposed concept of hierarchical context transfer (HCT) operates on several spatial levels of the input data to overcome major issues of next state prediction problems - density variability, a significant difference between consecutive states and computational complexity. The custom loss function allows assimilating contexts of spatial levels into each other to further improve prediction quality. The proposed deep learning model (HCT-CNN) allows generating precise high-resolution predictions of the target area. We evaluate our model on the use case of predicting the next state of the urban area using a large dataset for six cities - New York, Moscow, London, Tokyo, Saint Petersburg, and Vienna. Experimental results demonstrate that HCT-CNN generates low- and high-resolution predictions of better quality than existing methods.",

    text: "The rapid development of scientific and industrial areas, which rely on time series data processing, raises the demand for storage that would be able to process tens and hundreds of terabytes of data efficiently. And by efficiency, one should understand not only the speed of data processing operations execution but als…",
